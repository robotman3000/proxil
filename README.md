Transparent Proxy
=================

This repository contains files relevant for setting up a transparent proxy for HTTP and HTTPS by forwarding requests to a secondary HTTP proxy.

This setup can work on any Linux distributions, but the files here are aimed towards a router running DD-WRT , specifically on the Atheros MIPS architecture.
