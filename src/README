This program wraps a proxy CONNECT request over a normal HTTPS (TCP) request and forwards to a secondary proxy.

The python and C code are identical, the python is just for fun/local testing. Use the C code to run on the router.

To setup on a router. Copy over the tproxyhttps binary (Note this version is compiled for mips/atheros ar71XX)
and run bin/onrouter.sh from inside the router. (Change port numbers, ip addresses, tproxyhttps binary locations appropriately)
Note your router config may differ, use this only as a guide.


To compile from scratch use openwrt's ar71XX toolchain and compile as:
$ mips-openwrt-linux-gcc tproxyhttps.c -ldl  -lpthread -o tproxyhttps
Toolchain available at https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/OpenWrt-Toolchain-ar71xx-for-mips_34kc-gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2.tar.bz2
If your router does not use the atheros chipset or is not compatible with this mips version, use the appropriate toolchain for your architecture
